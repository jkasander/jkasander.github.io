<div id="mission">
	<p>Mission Statement: <br> Our mission is to provide fresh, organic, nutrient rich produce to our neighbors of limited means. <br> No child should be hungry or go wanting for vitamins and other essential nutrients their young bodies need to develop into healthy old ones. <br> We won't rest until every young person who needs healthy meal has one. </p>

<div id="testimonials">
